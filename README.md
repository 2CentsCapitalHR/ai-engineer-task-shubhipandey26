# 📄 ADGM Document Automation

This project automates the process of downloading **official ADGM (Abu Dhabi Global Market)** documents and templates from their government portals.  
It was built as part of a take-home AI engineering challenge, focusing on **clarity, code quality, and simplicity**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Automated Downloads** — Fetches multiple ADGM documents in one go.
- ✅ **Google Colab Ready** — Runs entirely in Colab, no local setup needed.
- ✅ **Organized Output** — Saves all downloaded files into a dedicated `downloaded_files/` folder.
- ✅ **Error Handling** — Skips invalid links and logs any failed downloads.
- ✅ **Beginner Friendly** — Step-by-step code and clear comments.
